On August 21, 2025, Rajamangala University of Technology Krungthep (RMUTK), 
led by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Phichai Chantraphuti, President of the University, together with executives, faculty members, and student representatives, met with General Chitsanuphong Rodklai, Assistant Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, to deliver the “Message Box from RMUTK.”

The box contained heartfelt messages handwritten on Post-it notes by students, staff, and members of the public — serving as words of encouragement to Thai soldiers stationed along the border.

This activity was part of the symbolic project titled “United Hearts of RMUTK: One Flag, One Heart for the Brave Thai Soldiers,” which encouraged students and university staff to write their sincere feelings and patriotic messages on Post-it notes attached to a national flag board. All messages were then gathered and handed over to the Royal Thai Army.

RMUTK emphasized that “Your words were strength. Your words had meaning.” Every message became an important source of motivation for the brave soldiers who are dedicated to protecting the nation.

The Post-it message delivery reflected the bond of care, patriotism, and unity between the university, the army, and the people — honoring the sacrifice of Thai soldiers on the front line.
